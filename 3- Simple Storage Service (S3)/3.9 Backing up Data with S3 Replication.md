# S3 Replication

- allows you to replicate objects from one bucket to another.
- versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
- objects in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
- delete markers are not replicated by default but you can enable it if you want.
- when replication is turned on only subsequent objects are replicated.
- replication can be applied to the entire bucket or specific sub-folders.
- replication can happen between buckets in different regions and even different AWS accounts.

*so if you have an existing bucket without replication enabled and you want to enable replication its best to create two buckets, enable replication, and then upload the objects in the old bucket to the new source bucket.* 
***HOWEVER! Since February 2022, AWS introduced S3 Batch Replication which allows on-demand replication of objects in existing buckets.***
