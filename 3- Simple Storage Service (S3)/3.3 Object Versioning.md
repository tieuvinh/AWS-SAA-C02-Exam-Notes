# Object Versioning in S3

- Versioning allows you to have multiple versions of the same object in a bucket.

## Advantages of S3 Buckets

- all versions of an object will be stored (even deleted versions).
- because of this it rovides a backup feature
- once enabled it cannot be deleted, only suspended
- can be integrated with lifecycle rules
- supports MFA (MFA delete)

**NOTE**: if a bucket is made public and there exists two versions of the same object then the latest version of the object is shown when you browse. The previous version will need to be explicitly made public to access it.

- when a versioned object is deleted a delete marker is placed in it. The delete marker will hold all the versions of the object. 
- to restore the objects simply delete the delete marker.
