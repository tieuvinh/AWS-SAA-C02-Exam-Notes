# S3 Performance Optimizations

- you can get the firt byte out of S3 within 100-200ms
- 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests and 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second, per prefix 

## S3 Prefix

- prefixes are simply the directories and subdirectories present in your buckets
- it does not include the object that is stored, only the directories/folders

`bucket-name/folder1/folder2/notes.txt` -> prefix is **/folder1/folder2**
`bucket-name/folder1/nudes.jpg` -> prefix is **/folder1**

- **to increase S3 performance simply spread your reads across multiple prefixes**

## Limitations with KMS

- if you're using KMS for S3 encryption you will be subjected to the limits of KMS
- when uploading an object to S3 you will call `GenerateDataKey` in the KMS API
- when you download a file you will call `Decrypt` in the KMS API
- doing uploads and downloads will count for the KMS quota
- KMS quota is region specific but its either 5500, 10000, or 30000 requests per second
- cannot increase the KMS quota

## Multipart uploads

- recommended for files over 100MB
- required for files over 5GB
- large files are split and parallelly uploaded 

## S3: Byte Range Fetches

- parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges
- if a failure occurs its limited to the byte range it occured
- can be used to download partial information of a files
