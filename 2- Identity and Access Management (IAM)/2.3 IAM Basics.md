# IAM Basics

## IAM Objects and Principles

**Users** - a physical person. Always one user account = one physical person.
**Groups** - users must be grouped here according to job fucntions
**Roles** - allows one part of AWS to access another part of AWS (ex: an EC2 instance needs to access an S3 bucket)

- When assigning permissions to users always attach policies to groups and add users to the group.
- Never share a single user account with multiple people otherwise, it will be hard to track.
- Access Keys and Secret access keys provide users with access to AWS CLI, API, and SDKs. You only get to see them once so download them as a csv file when they are generated or email them to yourself!
- passwords and access keys must be rotated!

**Principle of Least Privilege**: Only assign a user the minimum amount of privileges they need to do their job.
- AWS contains a lot of pre-built job function policies.

- When you create a user by default (skipping th permissions and assigning to group steps) they will have no permissions to any resources.

# Identity Providers

- SSO for AWS console
- makes it easier to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and provide users with SSO access to their assigned accounts from one place.
- can integrate with AD Environments too
