# Permissions 

- permissions are assigned using JSON policy documents like the one shown below

`{ 
	"Version": "2012-10-17"
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}	`

- The above policy can be read as such, "Allow all actions on all resources".
- To assign permissions, policy documents can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
- but the best practice is to always attach the policy document to a group and add the user to the group.
