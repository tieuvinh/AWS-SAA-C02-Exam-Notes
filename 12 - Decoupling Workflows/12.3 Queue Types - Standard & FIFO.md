# Queue Types

## SQS Standard Queues

- default queue type
- supports nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action.
- supports at-least-once message delivery, but occasionally more than one copy of a a message may be delivered out of order (message duplication is possible)
- provides best-effort ordering but not 100% guaranteed. 

## FIFO Queues

- used when order of operations and events is critical
- duplicates are not tolerated
- 300 requests per second
- pricier than standard queues

### FIFO key terms

1. **Message deduplication ID** 
- the token used for deduplication of sent messages.
- if a message with a particular message deduplication ID is sent successfully, any messages sent with the same ID are accepted successfully but aren't delivered during the 5-minute deduplication interval.
-  SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

2. **Message group ID**
- the tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group
- messages that belong to the same message group are always processed one by one, in a strict order relative to the message group

3. **Receive request attempt ID**
- token used for deduplication of `ReceiveMessage` calls.

4. **Sequence number**
- a large, non-consecutive number assigned to each message by SQS.
