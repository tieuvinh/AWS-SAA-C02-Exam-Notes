# Decoupling Workflows

## Tight Coupling
- components are built to fit a single purpose and are dependent on each other

User --> | Front end server | --> | Back-end server |


- the application is tightly coupled in the above scenario
- the front end server relies on the back-end server and vice versa

## Loose Coupling
- the components are somewhat detached from each other.
- every resource can have multiple back-ends and front ends
- systems are not directly dependent on each other
