## Route 53 Routing Policies

1. **Simple Routing**
- only one record  with multiple IP addresses.
- multiple values in a record will return all values to the user randomly. 

2. **Weighted Routing**
- allows you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned.
- ex: set 10% of your traffic go to us-east-1 and 90% to go to eu-west-1 
- if one record fails a health check then 100% of the traffic will be routed to the remaining record
- failed records will be removed from Route 53 until it passes the health check

3. **Failover Routing**
- used when you want to create an active/passive set up
- when the primary site health check fails, traffic will be automatically routed to secondary site.

4. **Geolocation Routing**
- lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users

5. **Geoproximity Routing**
- to use this you have to set up Route 53 Traffic Flow first
- combination of geographic location, latency, and availability to route traffic from users to your resources.
- you can build your traffic policy from scratch or choose a template from the library
- you can choose to route more/less traffic to a resource by specifying a value called bias.

6. **Latency-Based Routing**
- allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user
- whichever region that will give them the fastest response time is where the traffic will route to.
- to use this you create a latency resource record set for the EC2/ELB resource in each region

7. **Multivalue Answer Routing**
- lets you configure Route 53 to return multiple values in response to DNS queries
- lets you check the health of each resource
- basically simple routing with health checks on each record set
