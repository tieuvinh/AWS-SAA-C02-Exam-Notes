# Scaling Overview

## Vertical Scaling

- system meets demand requirements by adding resources (RAM, CPU etc.) to instance
- doesn't provide high availability since the single instance is scaling
- scaling is limited. At some point you won't be able to scale up further
- instances need to be restarted to scale

## Horizontal Scaling

- in here additional instances are added in order to handle an increase in load.
- provides high availability as multiple redundant servers might be available.
- instances can be scaled out across multiple AZs
- the only limit is cost
