# Scaling Relational and Non-Relational Databases

## Relational DB Scaling

- vertical scaling - resize DB from one size to another
- storage scaling - resize storage. But you can't rollback except for Aurora.
- Read replicas - if you have read heavy workloads you can take some load off the primary DB (not exactly scaling)
- Aurora Serverless - scaling is entirely managed by AWS. Best with unpredictable workloads.

- in the exam changing from a relational DB to a non-relational DB is a viable choice. 

## Non-relational DB Scaling (DynamoDB)

- with On-Demand mode you pay-per request (higher costs) but scaling is managed by AWS. 
- the Provisioned mode with Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts provisioned throughput capacity on your behalf in response to actual traffic
- the scaling policy determines what you will scale - read capacity, write capacity, or both.
- its also where you will define min and max provisioned capacity 
- target utilization is the ratio of consumed capacity units to provisioned capacity units, expressed as a percentage
- Changing from On-Demand to Provisioned mode is allowed but you won't be allowed to change back for ~24 hours. 
- When you delete a table or global table replica, any associated scalable targets, scaling polices or CloudWatch alarms are not automatically deleted with it.
