# Amazon Redshift

## Big Data

- Remember the 3Vs: Volume, Variety, and Velocity.
- Volume - terabytes to petabytes of data that need processing.
- Variety - data comes from a wide range of sources and formats.
- Velocity - the large volume of data needs to be collected, stored, processed, and analyzed within a short period of time. 

## Redshift

- fully-managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in AWS
- relational database but not a replacement or alternative for RDS.
- A Redshift data warehouse is composed of computing resources called nodes
- a group of nodes are called a cluster
- each cluster can contain one or more DBs
- clusters exist in a single AZ but you can do a relocation if AZ bottlenecks your cluster (cluster endpoint doesn't change so you don't have to edit your apps). 
- cluster relocation is only supported to RA3 instances only.
