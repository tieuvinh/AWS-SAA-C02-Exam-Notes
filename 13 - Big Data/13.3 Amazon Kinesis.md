# Amazon Kinesis

## Overview

- allows you to ingest, process, and analyze real-time streaming data
- get timely insights and react quickly to new information
- there are 4 Kinesis services;

1. *Kinesis Video Streams* - fully managed AWS service that you can use to stream live video from devices to the AWS Cloud, or build applications for real-time video processing or batch-oriented video analytics.
2. **Kinesis Data Streams** - used to collect large streams of data records in real-time. 
3. **Kinesis Data Firehose** -  fully managed service for delivering near real-time streaming data to destinations such as S3, Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch, or any custom HTTP endpoints (your own or third-party)
4. *Kinesis Data Analytics* - easiest way to transform and analyze streaming data in real time. 

## Kinesis Data Streams vs Kinesis Data Firehose

- if you are building or have your own data processing pipeline then Data Streams is for you.
- you must configure shards, manage scaling, and create data processing applications with Data Streams.
