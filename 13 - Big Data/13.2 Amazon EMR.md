# Amazon EMR 

## Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

- ETL is basically just data transformation. Read something in, reshape it, dump it elsewhere.
- search for dinner locations and get addresses of fancy restaurants (extract)
- translate the addresses so your Spanish girlfriend can understand (transform)
- write the translated addresses on a paper (load)

## EMR

- AWS's ETL Tool
- managed big data platform that allows you to process and analyze large amounts of data
- it simplifies running big data frameworks and uses open source tools like Hadoop, Spark, Hive, HBase, Hudi, and Presto
- also allows you to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and DBs such as S3 and DynamoDB. 
- EMR can run on EC2 instances, EKS, and Outposts.
- A serverless feature also exists (EMR Serverless)
