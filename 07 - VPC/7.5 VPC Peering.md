# VPC Peering

## Overview

- a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately.
- instances in both VPC can talk with each other as if they're on the same network.
- you can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region.
- there is no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck.
- you won't be charged for creating a VPC connection
- to establish a peering connection you shouldn't have any overlapping CIDR blocks.

## Inter-region VPC Peering

- traffic between these resources remain in the private IP address space.
- traffic is encrypted with no single point of failure, or bandwidth bottleneck.
- traffic always stay in the global AWS backbone and never traverses the Internet

## Multiple VPC Peering Connections

- transitive peering is not supported
- **B** <---> **A** <---> **C** : in this relationship VPC A is peered with VPC B and C. VPCs B and C cannot communicate with each other through VPC A. You must create another peering connection between B and C.

## Establishing a Connection

- *Requester* VPC sends a request to the owner of the *accepter* VPC to create the VPC peering connection
- Owner of accepter VPC accepts the connection request
- to enable flow of traffic, the owners must manually add routes to routing table
- update security groups of instances if required
- enable DNS hostname resolution for your VPC connection(if you have instances addressing each other using public DNS hostnames)
