## AWS Transit Gateway (TG)

## Overview

- provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks as a fully managed service
- no need to set up virtual or physical appliances additionally
- puts an end to complex peering relationships
- simplifies network architecture 
- acts as a cloud router

## Tips

- enables customers to connect thousands of VPCs (within same region).
- You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN and Direct Connect connections) to a single Transit Gateway instance
- this helps you to consolidate and control your org's entire AWS routing configs into one place
- hub-and-spoke model (simple management and reduced operational costs)
- TG is regional. Multiple TGs can be created per region.
- TGs can be peered using Transit Gateway Peering. This can be used to peer TGs in different/same regions.
