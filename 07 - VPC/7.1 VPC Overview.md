# VPC

## Overview

- virtual data center in the cloud
- logically isolated part of the AWS Cloud where you can define your own network.
- a subnet is always in one AZ

## Default VPC

- When you start using Amazon VPC, you have a default VPC in each AWS Region
- contains a public subnet in each AZ, an internet gateway, and settings to enable DNS resolution
- instances deployed to default public subnets get both a public and private IPv4 address, and private DNS host names.
- the default security group allows traffic from instances that have the same security group associated with them and allows all outbound traffic.
- the default ACL allows all types of traffic into and out of the subnet
