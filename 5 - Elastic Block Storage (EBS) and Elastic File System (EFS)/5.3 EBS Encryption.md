# EBS Encryption

- uses AES-256.
- EBS encryption uses AWS KMS and CMK when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

### What happens when you encrypt?
- data at rest inside the volume is encrypted
- data at flight between volume and instance is encrypted
- all snapshots are encrypted
- all volumes created from the snapshots are encrypted

### Features of EBS Encryption
- handled transparently (you don't have to do anything)
- minimal impact on latency
- **copying an unencrypted snapshot allows it be encrypted**
- **snapshots of encrypted volumes will be encrypted.**

### Encrypting an unencrypted volume
- Create a snap of the unencrypted volume
- create a copy of the unencrypted snapshot, select the encrypt option
- create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot   
- use this AMI to spin an EC2 with an encrypted EBS backing it
