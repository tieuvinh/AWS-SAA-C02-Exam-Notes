# AMIs - EBS vs, Instance Store

## AMI

- provides information needed to spin up an instance.
- AMIs are basically a blueprint for an EC2 instance
- you can base your AMI on 5 things- **region**, **OS**, **architecture (32-bit, 64-bit etc.)**, **launch permissions**, and **storage for root device volume**.
- AMIs are region specific
- can be backed by Amazon EBS or Instance Store.

# EBS backed AMI

- the root device is an EBS volume created from an EBS snapshot
- EBS-backed instances can be stopped or rebooted without data loss
- by default the root device volume will be deleted upon termination of the instance
- but you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume with EBS volumes

# Instance Store

- the root device is an instance store volume created from a template stored in S3.
- instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage
- they cannot be stopped and if the underlying piece of hardware fails you will lose your data
- you can however reboot the instance without any data loss.
