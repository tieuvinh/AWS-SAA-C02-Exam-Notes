# Volumes and Snapshots

## Volumes
- simply virtual hard disks
- you need at least one volume for an EC2 instance
- this volume is called the root device volume
- will always be in the same AZ as the EC2 it is attached to
- can be resized on the fly without stopping/restarting instances but will need to extend the filesystem from the OS.
- volume type can also be changed on the fly (gp2 to io2)

## Snapshots
- snapshots exist on S3
- snapshots are point in time
- snapshots are incremental. Only the changes in data from the previous snaps are moved to S3.
- the first snapshot my be large and take time to form in S3 since it has no previous version to increment from.
- snapshots only capture data that has been written into EBS.
- so for a consistent snap, save you works, stop your instances, and then snap.
- snapshots of encrypted EBS volumes will be encrypted as well.
- snapshots can only be shared within the region they were created
- if you want to share outside of the region then copy it first to the destination region
