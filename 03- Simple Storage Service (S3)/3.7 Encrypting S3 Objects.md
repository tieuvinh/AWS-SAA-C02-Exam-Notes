# S3 Encryption

Types of encryption
1. *Encryption in Transit* 
- encryption of data that is being sent to and from the bucket 
- done via SSL/TLS certificates, and HTTPS protocols

2. *Encryption at Rest- SSE* 
- encryption of data that is sitting inside the S3 bucket aka server-side encryption (SSE)
- there are 3 types: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C
- SSE-S3: Encryption keys are entirely managed by AWS and uses AES-256 encryption
- SSE-KMS: keys can be managed by customer using AWS KMS
- SSE-C: customer provided keys
- can be enforced using the console or bucket policy.

3. *Encryption at Rest- Client-side*
- this is encryption of objects before uploading them into S3
- data is encrypted while still in the client's side


- when uploading data into S3 PUT requests are send
- to encrypt objects a special header called `x-amz-server-side-encryption` is included in the request
- this header has two possible values
	1. `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES-256` -> tells S3 to use SSE-S3 encryption
	2. `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms` -> tells S3 to use keys from KMS for encryption
- to enforce encryption using bucket policy you have to tell S3 to deny any PUT request that doesn't include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption`.
