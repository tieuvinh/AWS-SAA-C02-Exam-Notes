# S3 Object Lock

- can use to store objects using a WORM model (Write Once Read Many)
- helps prevent the deletion or modification of an object for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
- can be used to comply with regulatory requirements or as data protection method.

## Governance Mode

- users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter it's data unless they have special permissions.
- but some users will be able to alter the retention or delete the object.

## Compliance Mode

- in this mode no user cannot modify, or delete an object.
- not even the root account
- once set in compliance mode you cannot change or shorten the retention period.
- this mode ensures that an object version cant be overwritten or deleted for a set amount of retention time.

*When you place a retention period on an object version, S3 stores a timestamp in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention expires*

## Legal Hold

- prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted.
- no retention period
- remains in effect until removed
- can be freely placed and removed by users who have the `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` permission.

# Glacier Vault Lock
