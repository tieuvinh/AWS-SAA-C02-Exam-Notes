# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

## Elastic Load Balancing
- automatic distribution of incoming app traffic across multiple targets
- can be done across multiple AZs
- health checks are configured and periodically send requests to LBs' registered instances to test their status.
- health checks are done on both healthy (InService) and unhealthy (OutOfService) instances
- requests are routed only to healthy instances--
- there are three types of ELBs

1. ***Application Load Balancer (ALB)***
- best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- operate at Layer 7 and are application aware
- intelligent LB

2. ***Network Load Balancer (NLB)***
- operates at connection level (layer 4)
- capable of handling millions of requests per second
- ultra-low latencies
- performance LB

3. ***Classic Load Balancer (CLB)***
- legacy LB
- load balance HTTP/HTTPS apps and use Laye 7 specific features such as sticky sessions and X-Forwarded
- suitable for test/dev work
