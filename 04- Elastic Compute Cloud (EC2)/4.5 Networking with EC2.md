# Different Virtual Network Adapters

- can attach three different types of network adapters to your EC2 instances

1. Elastic Network Interface (ENI) - for day-to-day networking
2. Enhanced Networking - high performance networking 
3. Elastic Fabric Adapter - used to accelerate HPC and ML apps


## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

- can have a primary private IPv4 address and one or more secondary IPv4 addresses
- can also contain one or more IPv6 addresses, an Elastic address per private IPv4 address, one or more security groups, and a MAC address
- can be used for management networks and low budget high availability network solutions

## Enhanced Networking (EN)

- high performance networking
- 10Gbps - 100 Gbps bandwidth support
- uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance
- SR-IOV provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization
- provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latency 
- no additional charge for using EN
- t2 instances don't support EN
- there are two flavors of EN,

1. Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
- supports up to 100Gbps
- all current gen instances **except C4, D2, and M4 instances smaller than m4.16xlarge** uses ENA for EN

2. Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface
- supports up to 10Gbps
- used by instances C3, C4, D2, I2, M4, and R3

## Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

- used to accelerate HPC and ML apps
- EFA is an ENA with added capabilities like OS-bypass
- provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based HPC systems
- OS-bypass allows HPC and ML apps to bypass the OS kernel and directly communicate with the network adapter
- OS-bypass is not supported on Windows, so it will function as an ENA
