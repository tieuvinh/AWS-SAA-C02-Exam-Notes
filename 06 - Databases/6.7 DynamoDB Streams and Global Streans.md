## DynamoDB Streams

- if any change happens to your table (modification of underlying data) happens an event is fired that captures that change
- the events are INSERT, UPDATE, and REMOVE log and carry the content of the row(s) being modified
- these events are guaranteed to be in the same order that the modifications took place
- stored for 24 hours
- data or sequences in a stream are broken into shards

## Global Tables

- a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-Region, multi-active database, without having to build and maintain your own replication solution.
- specify the AWS Regions where you want the tables to be available and DynamoDB will propagate ongoing data changes to all of them.
- no app rewrites
- multi-region redundancy for DR and HA
- replication latency can be under 1s

- ideal for massively scaled applications with globally dispersed users
