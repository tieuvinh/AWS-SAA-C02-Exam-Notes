# DynamoDB Transactions

## ACID Model

**Atomic** - all changes made to the data must be performed successfully or not all.
**Consistent** - data must be in a consistent state before and after a transaction.
**Isolated** - no other process should be able to change the data while the transaction is running.
**Durable** - changes made by a transaction must persist.

- DynamoDB Transactions provide ACID across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account or region.
- DynamoDB Transactions allow you to write or read a batch of items from DynamoDB, and the entire request will succeed or fail together.
- 3 read options- eventual consistency (\~1s), strong consistency, and transactional.
- 2 write options- standard and transactional

## Use Cases
