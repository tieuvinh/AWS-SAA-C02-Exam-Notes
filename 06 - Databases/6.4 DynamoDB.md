# DynamoDB

- fully managed, fast and flexible NoSQL database
- good for apps that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
- supports both document and key-value data models
- use cases include mobile apps, web apps, gaming, ad-tech, and IoT etc.
- runs on SSD storage
- spread across 3 AZs
- you get eventually consistent reads by default (consistency of all data copies is reached within ~1s)
- you can choose to have strongly consistent reads tho (successful writes prior to the read are made consistent)
- encryption at rest using KMS

# DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- fully-managed, highly available, in-memory caching service for DynamoDB
- up to 10x performance boost for DynamoDB
- reduces request times from milliseconds to microseconds even under load
- no need for developers to manage caching logic
- compatible with DynamoDB API calls

## Pricing
1. On-Demand Capacity Mode
- charges you for the data reads and writes.
- good if you have unknown workloads, unpredictable traffic, and only want to pay for what you use.

2. Provisioned Capacity Mode
- you specify the number of reads and writes per second that your app may need.
- good if you have predictable app traffic, and can forecast capacity requirements.
