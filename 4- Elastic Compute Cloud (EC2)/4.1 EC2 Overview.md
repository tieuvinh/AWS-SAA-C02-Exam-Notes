# EC2 Overview

- secure, virtual, scalable VMs hosted in AWS
- pay for what you use economic model
- no wasted computing capacity. You can grow and shrink the server as per the requirement.
- can be deployed within minutes.


## Pricing Options

### On-Demand

- pay by the second or hour, depending on the type of instance you run.
- you pay only for the seconds your instance is in a "running" state
- no upfront payments or long-time commitments
- typical use cases are applications with shirt-term, unpredictable, spiky workloads that can't be interrupted.
- also good for applications that are being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time.


### Reserved

- perfect for applications with steady state or predictable workloads
- or for applications that have a specific capacity requirement
- with reserved instances you have to pay for the term regardless of usage time.
- payments can be made in three ways: *full upfront*, *partial upfront* (remainder billed at a discounted hourly rate), *no upfront* (billed at a discounted hourly rate for entire term)
- can be purchased for one year or three year commitments (highest discount is 3 year option)
- do not renew automatically. Once term is ended your EC2 will be charged On-Demand rates


- **Spot**: instances created off unused AWS capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Pricing changes with supply and demand.
