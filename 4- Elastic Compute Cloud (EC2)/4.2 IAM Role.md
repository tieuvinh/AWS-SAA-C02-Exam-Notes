# IAM Role

- an AWS identity that has permission policies that determine what it can and cannot do in AWS.
- it is similar to a user in AWS but it isn't uniquely associated with one person.
- roles are assumable by anyone who needs it.
- do not have standard long term credentials - passwords or access keys.
- when roles are assumed it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.
- roles can be assumed by people, AWS architecture, and other system-level accounts.
- can also provide cross account access.
- roles are global.
- roles are the best way to grant AWS resources permissions rather than hard coding credentials.
