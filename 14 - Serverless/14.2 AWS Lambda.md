# AWS Lambda

## Overview

- serverless compute service
- lets the user run code without provisioning or managing the underlying servers. 
- built in logging and monitoring using CloudWatch and CloudWatch logs.
- you can use Lambda to add features to AWS (automate stuff etc.)

## Lambda Function Components

1. ***Runtime***
- pick from an available runtime or bring your own
- what language will you be using?

2. ***Permissions***
- if the Lambda function needs to make an AWS API call, attach a role.

3. ***Networking***
- can be used without defining a VPC
- if you need the Lambda to interact with endpoints in a VPC then you need to define a VPC, subnet, and security groups.

4. **Resources**
- define the CPU, memory needed to run the code. 
- memory can be set between 128MB to !0GB.
- code can only be run for 15 minutes before timing out. 

5. ***Trigger***
- triggers will kick off the Lambda function
