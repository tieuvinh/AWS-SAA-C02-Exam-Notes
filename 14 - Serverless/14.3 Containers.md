# Container

## Overview

- a container is a unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies 
- for example, a PHP app might package up a web server, a readable file system, and the PHP engine
- containers only have what they need to run the desired app
- very easy to run containers and move it around to different environments

## Container Stuff

- **Dockerfile** - a text document that contains commands and instructions that will be used to build an image.
- **Image**- unchanging file that contains code, libraries, and dependencies, and config files needed to run the app
- **Registry**- stores images for distribution. Can be private or public
- **Container** - a running copy of the image that has been created.
