# AWS Fargate

## Overview

- serverless, compute engine for containers
- works with ECS and EKS
- you can cut down the servers that are used to run your ECS/EKS workloads
- managed by AWS
- Linux-only workloads

## EC2 vs Fargate

1. **EC2**
- responsible for underlying OS
- EC2 pricing model (better option due to spot and reserved instances)
- better for long running containers
- multiple containers can share the same host

2. **Fargate**
- no OS access
- pay based on resources allocated and time ran
- ideal for short running tasks (serverless stuff are not the best for longer workloads)
- isolated environment
