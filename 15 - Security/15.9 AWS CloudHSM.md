# AWS CloudHSM

## Overview 

- provides hardware security modules (HSM) in the AWS Cloud.
- HSM is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys.
- it is a physical device, entirely dedicated to you.
- it is highly available (cluster architecture)
- **you do not use AWS IAM users or policies to access resources within your cluster**
- **you use HSM users directly on the hardware security module (HSM) with AWS CloudHSM.**

## KMS vs. CloudHSM

| KMS                                   | HSM                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| shared tenancy of underlying hardware | dedicated HSM to you, full control of underlying hardware |
| automatic key rotation and generation | no automatic key rotation                                 |
| Key access is controlled by you + AWS | full access management is your responsibility             |
