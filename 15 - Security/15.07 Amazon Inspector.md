# Amazon Inspector

## Overview

## Findings

- a finding describes the vulnerability. IDs the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance.
- severity does not indicate the criticality or importance of an affected resource to your organization.
- findings can be reviewed from Inspector console, or from detailed reports (CSV or JSON formats).
- finds a re automatically exported to EventBridge, and optionally to S3 buckets.
