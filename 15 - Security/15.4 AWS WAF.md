# AWS WAF

## Overview

-  is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API. 
- you can specify criteria (such as source IP addresses, values of query strings etc.) that will allow or forbid access to the requested resources.
- operates at Layer 7

## Behaviors

- at the simplest level, WAF lets you choose one of the following

1. Allow all requests except the ones that you specify
2. Block all requests except the ones you specify
3. Count requests that match your criteria
4. Run CAPTCHA checks against requests that match your criteria

- sometimes WAF might run into internal error that delays the response to requests that pass through it.
- on such instances CloudFront typically allows the request, while the Regional services typically deny the request and don't serve the content. 

## Web ACLs

-  gives you fine-grained control over all of the HTTP(S) web requests that your protected resource responds to. 
- you can use below criteria (or even a combination of them) to allow or block requests 
1. IP address origin of the request
2. Country of origin of the request
3. String match or regular expression (regex) match in a part of the request
4. Size of a particular part of the request
5. Detection of malicious SQL code (SQL injection) or scripting (XSS)
6. Values in request headers
