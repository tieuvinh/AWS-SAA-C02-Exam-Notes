# Parameter Store 

- a capability of AWS Systems Manager.
- provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management.
- you can store data such as passwords, DB strings, AMI IDs, and license codes as parameter values.
- you can store values as plain text or encrypted data.
- Parameter Store is hosted in multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region.
- you can reference parameters in your scripts, commands, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique name that was used to create the parameter.
- **Parameter Store is free (standard parameters)**
- you can change a standard parameter (max. size 4KB) to an advanced parameter (max. size 8KB) at any time
- you canâ€™t revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter.
