# DDoS Attacks

## What

- attacks that attempt to make your website or application unavailable to end users.

## Layer 4 DDoS Attack

- Often called a SYN Flood attack.
- work at the transport layer
- The attacker initiates a TCP handshake but don't send ACK packets to initiate a connection
- this causes the target server to wait for the ACK packet by using its own compute resources

## Amplification Attack

- attacker send malicious request t third party server using a spoofed IP
- the target server responds to that request with a greater payload (28-54 times) than the request
