# RDS Overview

- basically an EC2 instance with a DB engine running
- you do not have access to the low-level instance/OS
- only allowed to manage the DB engine

## Database Engines in AWS RDS

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Aurora (Amazon proprietary)

## Advantages of RDS

- Up and running in minutes
- multi AZ support
- automatic failover
- automated backup

- RDS is often used for online transaction processing (OLTP)
- Not suitable for analyzing large amounts of data, instead of RDS use something like Redshift

## Multi-AZ RDS

- RDS creates an exact copy of your production DBs in another Availability Zone.
- AWS handles the replication
- when you write to the primary DB it will also be synchronized to the secondary DB.
- Multi-AZ is supported by SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle.
- Aurora is always Multi-AZ
- if the primary DB fails the connection string (web address of where the DB is, and username and password) is automatically pointed to the secondary DB
- handled like a DNS fail over
- it is a **DR** solution **not a performance enhancing feature**, you cannot connect to the secondary DB when primary is active.
