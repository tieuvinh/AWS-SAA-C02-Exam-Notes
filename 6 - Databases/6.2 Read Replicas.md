## Read Replicas

- read-only copy of your primary DB.
- you can set it up so that queries are made to the read replica and not the main DB
- this will take the querying load off the main DB
- great for read heavy workloads
- main use case is scalability/performance
- can be multi-AZ or cross region
- each read replica has their own unique DB
- can be promoted to be its own DB but this will stop replication.
- automatic backups must be enabled to have read replicas
- you can have up to 5 read replicas per DB instance
