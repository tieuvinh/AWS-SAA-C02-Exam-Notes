# Application Load Balancer

## Listeners
- checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure.
- you define rules that tell the LB how to route requests to its registered targets
- each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions

## Rules
 - when the conditions for the rule is met, then its actions are performed
 - you must have a default rule for each listener and optionally define additional rules.

## Target Groups
 - target groups routes requests to one or more registered targets using the protocol and ports you specify

## Path-Based Routing
- can look at the path and make routing decisions
- because ALB is intelligent 

## Limitations
- only support HTTP and HTTPS
- to use an HTTPS listener you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS server certificate
