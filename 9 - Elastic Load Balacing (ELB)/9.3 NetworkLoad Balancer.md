# Network Load Balancer (NLB)

## How it works
- after receiving a connection request, it selects a target from the TG for the default rule
- it then attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified on the listener config. 
- there are no rules like in an ALB, not intelligent.

**Supported Ports and Protocols**- TCP/TLS/UDP/TCP_UDP and any port (1-65535)

## Use Cases
- load balancing TCP traffic
- extreme performance requirements
- capability to handle millions of requests per second and ultra-low latencies.
