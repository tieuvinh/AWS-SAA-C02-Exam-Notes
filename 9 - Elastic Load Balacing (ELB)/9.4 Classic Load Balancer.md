# Classic Load Balancer

## Overview

- legacy LBs
- can load balance HTTP/HTTPS apps 
- use layer 7 specific features like sticky sessions and X-Forwarded
- can also use layer 4 LB'ing for apps that rely on the TCP protocol
- when app stops responding the CLB responds with a 504 error

## X-Forwarded-For

- servers sitting behind an LB will only log the IP address of the proxy or LB in the server access logs
- to see the original IP address of the client the X-Forwarded-For header is used

## Sticky Sessions

- allows you to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance
- if a bound EC2 instance becomes unavailable the sticky session will still be in effect and cause problems
- as a workaround disable Sticky Sessions
