## EC2 Behavior

- when we *stop* instances, the data is kept on the disk (EBS).
- this data will remain until the EC2 instance is started.
- if instance is terminated, the by default, the root device volume will also be terminated.
- when EC2 instance is started the OS boots up, boot strap scripts run, and the apps start.

## EC2 Hibernation

- hibernation = suspend-to-disk
- hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your EBS root volume. 
- with this instances are able to boot much faster
- the OS doesn't need to reboot since the in-memory contents are preserved
- this is useful for long running processes, and services that take a long time to initialize
- to hibernate the RAM must be lower than 150GB
- instances cannot be hibernated for more than 60 days
- available on on-demand and reserved instances.

## Hibernation Behavior

- root volume is restored to previous state
- RAM contents are reloaded
- processes that were running on the instance are resumed
- previously attached data volumes are reattached and instance retains its instance ID
