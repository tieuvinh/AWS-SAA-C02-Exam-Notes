# VPC Endpoints

## Overview 

- enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS Services and VPC endpoint services
- does not require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
- instances don't need public IP addresses to communicate using VPC endpoints
- this is useful when you don't want your traffic between your VPC and the other service to not leave the AWS backbone network
- virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available
- no availability risks or bandwidth limitations

## Types

1. Interface endpoints - ENI with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic
2. Gateway endpoints - similar to NAT getways, it is a virtual device. Supports S3 and DynamoDB
