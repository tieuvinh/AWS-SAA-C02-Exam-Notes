- aggregates multiple VPNs from multiple sites to connect with each other and your VPC
- enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC
- operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC
- operates over the public Internet, but all traffic between the customer gateway and the AWS VPN CloudHub is encrypted. 
- sites must not have overlapping IP addresses
- hub-and-spoke model
- potentially low-cost
