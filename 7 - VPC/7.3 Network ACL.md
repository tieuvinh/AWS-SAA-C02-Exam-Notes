# Network ACL (NACL)

## Overview 

- works at the subnet level
- acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
- default NACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic
- custom NACLs by default blocks everything
- a subnet MUST have an NACL. If an NACL is not attached the subnet will be automatically associated with the default NACL.
- IP addresses must be blocked with NACLs not SGs
- multiple subnets can be associated with one NACL
- but a subnet can only have one NACL association at a time
- if another NACL is associated the previous one is removed from the subnet
