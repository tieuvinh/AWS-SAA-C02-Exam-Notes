# DNS Overview

## Stuff You Should Know About DNS and AWS

1. *Top-level domain* - controlled by IANA in a root zone DB. ex: .com, .gov, .lk, .uk
2. *Domain Registrars* - all names in a domain name must be unique. Domain registrars organize this all so that domain names aren't duplicated. Registrars have the authority to assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains. ex: domain.com, GoDaddy, Hoover, AWS, Namecheap
3. *TTL* - the length of time a DNS record is cached on either the resolving server or the user's local PC. Lower the time, the faster DNS records take to propagate throughout the Internet. 

## DNS Records Overview

1. SOA Record
- name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
- zone admin
- current version of data file
- default number of seconds for the TTL file on resource records

2. NS Record
- used by TLD servers to direct traffic to the content DNS server that contains the authoritative DNS records

3. A Record
- used by a computer to translate the name of the domain to an IP address

4. CNAME record
- used to resolve one domain name to another domain name
- cannot be used for naked domain names (zone apex record) like example.com
- can be used for subdomains like m.example.com

5. Alias records
- map resource record sets in your hosted zone to LBs, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets configured as websites
- kinda like a CNMAE record because ine DNS name (www.example.com) is mapped to another target DNS name (elb1234.elb.amazon.aws.com)
- only used in AWS
